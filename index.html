            <div class="subtitle">
                <p>I should be allowed to ‘Hep’ in the Nyaa server as Teuth is allowed to Nyaa with unfettered access. I do not view this as fair. While I don’t blame Teuth for these decisions and am supportive of them getting to Nyaa whenever for times in which they need to let off stress from activities such as buying a game in Canada, being cold in Canada, hearing people speak French (French scares me), wanting to be silly, wanting to be quirky, not consuming a minion meme in an appropriate amount of time, etc, there are a myriad of reasons as to why Teuth can Nyaa. The appealing party who has jurisdiction over this is ‘bums’ (short for bumiticus) (which in turn is short for a whitefly insect native to the Burmese amber region, named ‘Aleurodicus burmiticus Cockerell’ found in 1919). Bums as we shall call them moving forward, has supreme authority over this channel, as such we will be appealing to them.</p>
